# ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL

## Welcome to our final project idea!

For our final project we are going to create a simply AWESOME video game.

Premise:

_**In a world... There is one car... AND ...A sleepy driver. You are the passenger!**_

In our video game it is the passengers job to keep take the wheel and keep the car on the road.

You will have to avoid oncoming objects to achieve the highest score possible until you inevitably crash the car.

The game will be controlled by a single click or touch interface.
